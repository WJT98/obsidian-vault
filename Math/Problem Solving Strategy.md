Discover and solve simpler analogous problems 


1. Understand the Problem
	- What is given by the problem? 
	- Can we group different data points from some unique characteristic?
2. Devise a plan
	-  Eliminate possibilities
	- Use symmetry
	- Consider edge cases
	- Look for patterns
	- solve a simpler problem
	- Draw picture
3. Carry out a plan
	- Discard quick if it doesn't work and restart
4. Reflect/Extend
	- What worked, what didn't
	- Where else can this solution be used
	- Learn to predict what strategy to use to solve future problems
	- Look for more elegant solutions

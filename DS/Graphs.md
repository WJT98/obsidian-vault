# Types of Graphs
## Undirected Graph
- Edges are bidirectional

## Directed Graphs
- Edges only point in 1 direction

## Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAG)
- Topological sorting is the most important operation on DAG's

## Connected Graph
- Graph in which there is always a path from a vertex to any other vertex

## Complete Graph
- Graph in which every vertex has an edge to each other
- ${n \choose 2}$ =  $n(n-1)/2$ edges

## Spanning Tree
 - Sub-graph of an undirected connected graph which includes all the vertices of a graph with a minimum possible number of edges. (Must include all vertices)
 - Edges may have weights
 - $n-1$ edges
 - Remove a maximum of e - n + 1 edges from a complete graph to construct a spanning tree
 
>[!Note]
>The total number of spanning trees with `n` vertices that can be created from a complete graph is equal to $n^{(n-2)}$

## Minimum Spanning Tree
- Spanning tree in which sum of weight of edges are minimized

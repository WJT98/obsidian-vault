- Orders the vertices on a line such that all directed edges go from left to right
- Such an ordering cannot exist if the graph contains a directed cycle
- Each [[Graphs#Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAG)|DAG]] has at least one topological sort

>[!Purpose]
>Gives an ordering where each vertex can be processed before it's successors. This allows us to seek the shortest/longest path from x to y in a DAG

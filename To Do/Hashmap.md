# Hashmap

## Collision Resolution
- Chaining (linked list): Disadvantage is that a lot of memory used to build linked lists could have just been to increase the table size
## Open Addressing
- If cell is occupied, use **************************sequential probing************************** to find next available cell
-   Searching for an item no requires additional checking
-   Deletion requires reinsertion of all items after the hole

# Implementation

```python

```
